## :rocket: Coding for the Game Boy

For curious its built with GBDK 2020 and heres the [GBDK 2020 C Guidelines](https://gbdk-2020.github.io/gbdk-2020/docs/api/docs_coding_guidelines.html#docs_c_tutorials) this will walk you through some of the limitations and tricks to make C run effeciently on the Game Boy. So if your wondering why so many things are globals or why I dont do things a certain its mostly because the game boy hardware really doesnt like those things.
